Description: This package computes the distribution function of the largest root
    statistic in both the single and double Wishart settings. This test statistic
    is especially useful in multivariate analysis. The computations are based on
    results by Chiani (Journal of Multivariate Statistics 2014 and 2016). They
    use the fact that the CDF is related to the Pfaffian of a matrix that can be
    computed in a finite number of iterations.
