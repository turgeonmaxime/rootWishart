Description: Functions for hypothesis testing in single and double Wishart
    settings, based on Roy's largest root. This test statistic is especially
    useful in multivariate analysis. The computations are based on results by
    Chiani (Journal of Multivariate Statistics 2014 and 2016). They use the fact
    that the CDF is related to the Pfaffian of a matrix that can be computed in
    a finite number of iterations. This package takes advantage of the Boost and
    Eigen C++ libraries to perform multi-precision linear algebra.
